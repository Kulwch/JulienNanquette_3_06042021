Third project in the Web develop course by OpenClassroom

Ohmyfood: based on a mobile-first website mockup, develop the site with html and css in three versions: mobile, pad and desktop. Ohmyfood is an online meal ordering in gastronomic restaurants to prevent from waiting when arriving on location: the meals are already prepared.
The site has an index page that refers to four restaurants' menus.
As a "favorite" button will later allow to select the restaurant in a favorite list, the :hover and :focus effects on the heart icon are to be displayed: the heart must fill progressively.
Every link has to have :hover effects at least.

Several visual effects are needed: for further information, report to the creative brief.

No framework is allowed, Sass is on opposite needed.

The site will be displayed on a github page with a scss.file that GitHub will translate for himself in css.
